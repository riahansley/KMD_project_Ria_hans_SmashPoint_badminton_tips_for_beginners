                <p>
                    The sport of badminton, as recognized today, developed during the mid-19th century, 
                    evolving from earlier recreational games involving a shuttlecock and racquets. While 
                    the precise origins of the game are uncertain, it is known that British expatriates 
                    in India formalized rules and competitive play, transforming a casual pastime into 
                    an organized sport.

                <p>
                    The name “badminton” is associated with Badminton House, the estate of the Duke of 
                    Beaufort in Gloucestershire, though the connection between the location and the 
                    game’s adoption remains unclear. Historical records indicate that early attempts 
                    to document the game occurred in the 1860s, though few of these sources have survived. 
                    Contemporary accounts describe a version of the game played with opposing teams, 
                    separated by a string or net, reflecting the foundational structure of modern badminton.

        <h3>Badminton in the Early Years</h3>
        <p>
            In its earliest form, badminton emerged among British residents in India, 
            where it was commonly called Poona or Poonah after the city where it gained 
            widespread attention. Originally, the game did not have a fixed number of 
            players, but over time it was formalized for either singles or doubles matches. 
            The shuttlecocks used during this period were typically reinforced with India 
            rubber to improve durability and flight.

        <h3>Modern Badminton Rules</h3>
        <p>
            Badminton continued to be played according to the Pune rules until 
            1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the Bath Badminton Club introduced a set 
            of revised regulations, laying the foundation for a more standardized 
            version of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            These regulations were subsequently published by the Badminton Association 
            of England (BAE) in 1893, marking the official establishment of the sport 
            in Portsmouth. The first organized tournaments took place in 1899, with 
            singles competitions being incorporated the following year, in 1900.
